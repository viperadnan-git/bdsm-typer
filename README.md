1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the BDSMTyper project.
2. Run the following command to make the build.sh script executable:

```
chmod +x build.sh
```

3. Run the build.sh script by executing the following command:

```
./build.sh
```

4. The build process will start, and once it's complete, you'll find the BDSMTyper executable file in the `dist` directory.
